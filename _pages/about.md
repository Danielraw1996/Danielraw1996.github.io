I am a 4th year Chemical and Biological Engineering student at UBC, with a specialization in Process Control. 

Aside from my studies, I enjoy working in the lab and making projects, some of which are shown in the project panel on this site.

In my free time, I play tennis for the UBC Mens's Tennis Team, and try and get on my mountain bike as often as possible.
