When a speaker is driven, it pulses at certain frequencies, which correlates to the sounds heard. When a bar is attached from a speaker to a metal plate, the metal plate is then vibrated at said specific freqency. If this frequency were to be at a harmonic, the plate will vibrate in patterns, showing nodes and anti-nodes throughout the metal. This is shown with salt!
